# Hangman_Game


The hangman game is a traditional game in which the players' objective is to guess the given hidden word by precising each time a letter of the word. 

The player has the right to make the wrong guesses 5 times. Once the 5 chances are run out and the hidden word has not been revealed yet, the player loses the game.

The game was built as my first python programming project with some specific features such as:

- a list of thousands of english words by using the library "nltk.corpus"
- the image of the hangman created from different pictures with the usage of the library "IPython.display"
- the count function in order to have 5 seconds of processing every time when there is an input from the player (librairy "time") 
- choices of the difficulty levels and the topics of the word
- error-handling functions to only accept the correct input (string or integer) from the player

Please feel free to fork the code, play the game and have fun! :)
